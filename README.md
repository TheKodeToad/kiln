   - [x] Yarn Mappings (Mostly)
   - [ ] MCP Mappings
   - [x] Mojang Mappings (Without intermediary support)
   - [ ] Sand Mappings? (Custom GlassMC Mappings)
 - [x] Depending On Shards

 - [ ] Publish Task (Creating a PR in [registry](https://github.com/glassmc/registry))
   - [ ] Correctly Collecting Dependencies

## Testing
The current best way to test kiln is to run the **publishToMavenLocal** gradle plugin.
This publishes kiln to a local maven repository on your computer. After that you can use it as a dependency in a test shard.
